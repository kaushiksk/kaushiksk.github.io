  Hello there! I figured it was time I got a technical blog up and running, so here it spawns.
</div>

I've always loved to write but I've kept most of it to myself and almost none of it has been technical so this is going to be new.

I'll try to put up as much good content as frequently as possible, at least that's what I've promised myself.

I recently wrote a blog post for the [IEEE NITK BLOG](http://ieeenitk.org/blog/), where I wrote about some quick hacks on the terminal for Linux beginners, you can read it [here](http://ieeenitk.org/blog/getting-to-love-the-terminal/). I love working from the command line and I'll try to write about some new things I've found soon.

A long time ago when I was just beginning to learn programming and was loving Web Scraping I dug around the IMDb data a bit. If you're interested, here's the [link to that](https://exploretop250.wordpress.com/), but as you can see that didn't go too far. I'd written a simple python module to serve as an API for some IMDb data in a neat way and put it up on [github](http://github.com/kaushiksk/pymdb), I'll write a bit on that some day soon. 


Hope we'll all learn a lot in the days to come. Allons-y!
