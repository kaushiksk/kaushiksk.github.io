I'm Kaushik S Kalmady. Computer Science Undergraduate at National Institute of Technology Karnataka. 

I love python and the Linux Terminal! I have done considerable work in Machine Learning and Deep Learning and am very passionate about Open Source and Computer Science in general. I enjoy doing math and [read](https://www.goodreads.com/kaushiksk) a lot of books in my free time. I admire cinema and occassionally [write about it](https://dustyfilmreels.wordpress.com). I have an affinity towards for Classic Rock & Roll and Foreign Films and am trying to be good at playing the violin. I will always be keen to strike up a conversation about any of the above!

Most of my projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/kaushiksk).
