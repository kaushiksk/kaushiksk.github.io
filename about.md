I'm Kaushik S Kalmady. Computer Science Undergraduate at National Institute of Technology Karnataka. 

I love python and data! I'm interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Open Source.

I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/kaushiksk) and admire cinema and will always be keen to strike up a conversation about them!
